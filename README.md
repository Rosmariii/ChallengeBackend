# ChallengeBackend

# E-commerce style project

This project was [Create Node.js ](https://nodejs.dev/) 
The typescript language, the Postgres database and express were also used.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm install to install all the dependencies and then run with the npm run dev command
which compiles the typescript files to javascript so that later node.js can interpret it.

## Project status completed

## possible mistakes
Taking into account my little knowledge, I am not sure that it is a scalable 
project since it makes many queries to all the columns of the database. Also 
by not having an access token, any user could modify the database.

## Frequent questions
How could scalability be improved? How could it be better organized?
I still do not understand very well that it enters the .env file and I 
have doubts if the main index.ts file that is in the src folder is too many or 
if it is used in another way.
